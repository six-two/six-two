### Hello, World!

I am six-two, a pentester who also loves to write small scripts and programs. I also wrote a couple of MkDocs plugins, since I use it to keep my knowlege base.

You can find my projects on [Github](https://github.com/six-two?tab=repositories), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/users/six-two/projects?tab=repositories), and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/six-two/).
