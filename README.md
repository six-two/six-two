### Hello, World!

I am six-two, a pentester who also loves to write small scripts and programs. I also wrote a couple of MkDocs plugins, since I use it to keep my knowlege base.

You can find my projects on [Github](https://github.com/six-two?tab=repositories), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/users/six-two/projects?tab=repositories), and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/six-two/).

#### Commit signing

If you do not trust GitHub's commit signature checks, you can use the GPG commit signing key in this repository. It is used on most of my pre-2024 commits. On my latest computer I switched to using an dedicated SSH key, since it is easier for me to keep secure. But any time I change computers / set them newly up I will need to add a new key. My SSH signing keys are:

```
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBH5Xhot/FD0pmAve1gZyDcvFKTq+uIpSCvwOJKflBakXlqRK8lB7hUBz8r0wm1WxMaiBMHP6P1rntTac6zaNvCc= six-two:-Git-Commit-Signing-Key
```
